<h1>To-Do App ‚òëÔ∏è</h1>

<p>A work in progress To-Do App. Made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS/Bootstrap.</p>

<h2>About This App üìç</h2>

<p> As part of my apprenticeship learning, the To-Do App was a tutorial to follow as an introduction to JS. The original tutorial came from the Cloud Academy training system. Since completing, I want to build on this app, adding more features and styling for a more functional and appealing finish.

Currently users can: add a new to-do, delete individual to-do and delete all the To-Dos. </p>

<h2>Technologies üíª</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML: Structure of the app/web page</li>
  <li>Bootstrap CSS: Styling and layout</li>
  <li>JavaScript: Functionality of displaying, adding and deleting To-Dos</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Currently Looks </h2>
