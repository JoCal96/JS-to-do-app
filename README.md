<h1>To-Do App ‚òëÔ∏è</h1>

<p>A work in progress To-Do App. Made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS/Bootstrap.</p>

<h2>About This App üìç</h2>

<p> As part of my apprenticeship learning, the To-Do App was a tutorial to follow as an introduction to JS. The original tutorial came from the Cloud Academy training system. Since completing, I have continued to build on this app, adding more features and styling for a more functional and appealing finish.

Currently users can: add a new to-do, delete individual to-dos, delete all the To-Dos, edit a to-do and complete a to-do. completed to-dos get added to a completed tab which the user can switch between to view active and completed to-dos.

Working On: Currently complete - June 2024. </p>
